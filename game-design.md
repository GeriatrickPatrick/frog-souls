# frog souls

Genre: 2d souls like, exploration,


## background

Soul is the connection between differnet elements and the world, often 'personified' by different creatues. 

Frogs: respectful, powerful, and generous, inhibit frog soul.
Rats: sleezy, dirty, and sneaky, inhibit rat soul.
Beetles: robust, stubburn, and disiplined, inhibit beetle soul.

All creatures have soul, but the power of thier soul is amplified by thier connection to the land. This is why you often find creatures in certain environments, such as frogs near the pongs, rats in alleys, beetles minding thier own business under the rocks.

The environment itself also has soul: trees, mushrooms, bodies of water, the rocks, and the wind, all synergise with their surrounding elements. The concept of life isn't just reserved for creatures, but anything that can inhibit soul. This means the concept of a 'frog soul' isnt strictly to do with frogs, but the frogs connection to its environment, just like how a healthy pond soul would connect closely with frogs, algea, and all other like minded elements.

## story

Rats have long lived on humanities inability to clean after themselves, surviving in the allies of the cities and towns, living of waste produced by humanity. Although humans and rats clash, thier souls synergyse well, humans lack of responsibility inhibits the rats lack of ambition to achive thier own means of survival. The curse of rats upon the humans has been by the humans own design.

But, when the piles of waste stop apearing, and the water stops flowing, the rats have no means of survival. The rats have to look elsewhere to sustain thierselves. However, the rats cannot find a suitable environment that synergises with thier soul, as thier greed and selfishness is not well recieved by most soul pools. It is believed that rat souls during the age of humans where only as strong they where because they ciphed strength from the human souls.

The rats, realising their source of survival has gone, have been devising a plan of how they can continue to exist. They accept that many 'good' rats will be lost in the process, and it is likely only the highest in rat society will survive. 

Rat society exists in heieracy. At the bottom are the workers, as expected, spending thier days scavaging for scraps on the streets for the higherups, keeping a small cut of the portions for themselves. A worker rat that is underperforming or found sneaking rations is seen as nothing more than a meal for the higherups, as such the enforcement rats take care of business. 

Enforcement rats enforce the rules, making them very unpopular with the working rats. Any worker rat could tell you endless horror storys relating to how they have been mistreated by the rat enforcement. Patroling the streets in squadrons, these rats are simply following orders, and the rules that apply to underperforming worker rats also applys to the enforcement rats.

At the top there are the rat leaders, senior rats that make important descisions, not that there are any to be made, and the 'rat king', a unholy entity, comprised of over a dozen rats twisted together by the tails, and the one that rules over the rats. Even seeing the rat king is a great priviledge, although one not easily forgotton, let alone being in its presance for a extended time.

Of couse this is only a general structure of rat society, and it differs between civilisation, but generally the structure is the same. Tales and myths about how a simple worker rat became part of the rat king have been spread down by generations for centuries, the only proof being word of mouth. Although these tales bring hope to the worker rats that one day they will be living the high life, deep down they know it is no more than a tale, after all, if a worker rat had work thier way up and join the rat king, why haven't they done anything to improve the lives of all the common rats.

Sceptics amoung the rat workers believe the tales have been spread as propaganda by the rat overlords to motivate the workers. Publicly funded statues have even been erected in the honour of this rat, something recieved well by most, but not all. These rats would likely form a strong rebelion, if not for their rat soul, which prevents them from working well with even each other due to their greed and self importance. Their motive is stong though, as rats they want nothing more than to be the most important, the one at the top, but they have been born at the bottom, with very little they can do about it. From a rats perspective, the only thing they can do is look like they are working as hard as they can so they may one day work the ranks. Of course this never happens, the only way to be a rat overlord is to be born or married into it, marage not being the optimum route as these tend to be one sided and aranged between prospective rat households, who seem to like to keep it 'within the family'. 

The worker rats live to server others, which goes against thier own core beliefs, just to be at the top, which is a unachievable goal, made to seem achievable by the rat overlords, who only want the rats to work harder. 

Occasionally, a rat will figure this out. Luckily for the rat overlords, the rat sceptics never seem to have long to spread the news. A rat sceptics performance will drop as they realise they have no reason to work so hard. They even sometimes scavange on scraps themselves, hoping no one will notice. Unfortunatly for them, the change in performance is  almost always noticed within the first 42 rat hours, and by the 48th, they will be dead.
